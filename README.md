**1) Project Overview**

This project analyzes customer churn using Microsoft Excel. The objective is to identify key factors influencing churn and generate actionable insights using PivotTables, calculated fields, grouping, and dashboards. This project was completed as part of a DataCamp case study.

**2) Business Problem**

Customer churn directly impacts revenue and growth.
- The goal of this analysis is to:
- Calculate churn rate
- Identify high-risk customer segments
- Analyze churn by demographic and service usage variables
- Provide insights to reduce churn

**3) Tools & Techniques Used**

- Microsoft Excel
- PivotTables
- Calculated Fields (Churn Rate %)
- Value Filters (Top 25 states)
- Age Grouping (10-year intervals)
- KPI calculation
- Data visualization (Bar & Column charts)

**4) Key Analysis Performed**

a) Created a calculated field:
- Churn Rate % = Churned Customers / Total Customers
b) Analyzed churn by:
- Unlimited Data Plan
- Age Groups
- State
- Average Consumption Levels
c) Created visualizations:
- Stacked column chart (Churn by Plan & Consumption)
- KPI dashboard displaying overall churn rate

**5) Key Insights**

- Customers without an unlimited data plan show a significantly higher churn rate.
- Younger age groups (20–30) have higher churn.
- High data consumers are more likely to churn when not subscribed to unlimited plans.
- Certain states rank in the top 25 for churn rate.

**5) Business Recommendations**

- Target high-consumption users with unlimited plan promotions.
- Offer retention incentives for younger customer segments.
- Focus retention campaigns on high-churn states.
